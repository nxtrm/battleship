- Take Turns: After placing ships, players take turns to attack by clicking on the opponent's board. A red square means a "hit", the player gets a second turn. The green square means a "miss".
- Win the Game: The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponent's ships. The winner is displayed, and players can choose to play again or quit.

## File Structure
- battleship_final.py: Main game file containing the implementation of the game logic and GUI.
  
## Dependencies
- customtkinter: For creating the GUI.
- Pillow: For handling images.
- pygame: For playing sound effects.(I honestly forgot already)
